## Linux as OS ##
Linux has always been my favorite operating system when it comes to software/hardware development. I understand the needs of Windows operating system which people are heavily depending on everyday. However, personally, I think Linux will be the future for many of the out technological backend solution (such as server, cloud and embedded system). I also like the open-source concept and most of all I love the CLI on terminal.
